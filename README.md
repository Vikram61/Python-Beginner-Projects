## 🚀 Projects

### 1. 🎯 Guess the Number 1
A basic number guessing game where the computer selects a random number and the player tries to guess it in as few attempts as possible.

**Concepts Practiced:**  
- Input/output  
- Loops  
- Random module

---

### 2. 🧠 Guess the Number 2 (Computer Guesses)
A reverse version where the **computer guesses the number** you're thinking.

**Concepts Practiced:**  
- Loops and conditionals  
- User feedback loop

---

### 3. 💀 Hangman
The classic word guessing game where the player guesses letters one at a time. Too many wrong guesses and the player loses.

**Concepts Practiced:**  
- String manipulation  
- Sets  
- Input validation  
- Game loop logic

---

### 4. ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe
A 2-player (or human vs computer) game of Tic Tac Toe with logic to detect winning combinations.

**Concepts Practiced:**  
- Lists and 2D arrays  
- Game state tracking  
- OOP with classes and inheritance  
- Minimax algorithm (for AI version)

---

### 5. 💣 Minesweeper
A simplified terminal-based Minesweeper game where the player uncovers cells and avoids hidden bombs.

**Concepts Practiced:**  
- 2D list traversal  
- Recursion (flood fill)  
- Game logic and representation  
- Randomized grid generation
